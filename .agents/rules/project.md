# Project Structure

Use the `project-*` skills as the source of truth for work that changes the
repository, GitOps layout, stage content, documentation structure, manifest
standards, or shared agent guidance:

- `.agents/skills/project-structure/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/project-agent-guidance/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/project-demo-stage-authoring/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/project-gitops-authoring/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/project-documentation-authoring/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/project-manifest-review/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/project-architecture-diagrams/SKILL.md`

Keep the demo coherent as a multi-agent research story for enterprises using
Red Hat OpenShift AI and NVIDIA technologies. GitOps, stage READMEs,
operational docs, architecture diagrams, and agent guidance must stay aligned
with the active baseline in `docs/PLATFORM_BASELINE.md`.

New demo stages must be created as root-level `stage-YXX-slug/` folders.

Use `project-demo-stage-authoring` for every new demo stage. Start with intent,
source capture, skill routing, and `PLAN.md`; then author the README, GitOps,
Argo CD Application, manifests, deploy script, validation script, and review
evidence as one atomic stage. Do not let README claims, GitOps manifests, and
validation scripts drift apart.

Do not silently defer or remove components from an agreed stage scope. If a
component is too risky, blocked, or better suited for a later stage, pause and
discuss the tradeoff with the user before changing its status. Record the
accepted decision in the stage `PLAN.md` or `docs/BACKLOG.md`.

Stage READMEs should be concise Why/What documents: introduce the business
concept, map the concept to official Red Hat and NVIDIA product documentation,
and show the architecture delta. GitOps artifacts and live demos show the How.

Documentation-alignment and operator-GitOps skills (ported from the proven
rhoai3-demo project):

- `.agents/skills/project-doc-alignment-audit/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/project-red-hat-doc-alignment-review/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/project-red-hat-doc-skill-authoring/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/project-red-hat-operator-gitops/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/project-rhoai-doc-chapter-skill-authoring/SKILL.md`

Use `project-red-hat-doc-skill-authoring` when turning official Red Hat
product documentation into `rhoai-*`, `ocp-*`, or `odf-*` component skills.
The older `project-rhoai-doc-chapter-skill-authoring` remains compatible for
RHOAI-only chapter work. Before selecting or creating a product skill,
consult `.agents/references/red-hat-doc-map.yaml` to map the official Red
Hat product, version, category, book, and chapter topic to an existing or
planned flat skill. Generated component skills must capture official
sources, extraction notes, validation rules, examples, and the
corresponding doc-map route before they are treated as reusable product
guidance.

Use `project-red-hat-operator-gitops` when deploying Red Hat Operators
through GitOps. Follow the Red Hat Community of Practice catalog structure
as a local curation pattern: operator base, channel overlay, instance
resources, optional components, and aggregate overlays. Do not commit
direct remote Kustomize references to the community catalog; product fields
and channels still come from official Red Hat docs and product skills.
Operator lifecycle management is also GitOps state: channel changes,
approval strategy, selected overlay, product baseline, and operand patches
should be changed in Git and reconciled by Argo CD, not maintained as live
Subscription drift.

Classify image ownership before changing any image value. Do not pin images
solely to create repeatability; Red Hat Operators package operational
knowledge so platform components are installed, configured, and managed in
an automated, repeatable, and supported way. Explicit image tags or digests
are exceptions that require Red Hat documentation, a validated artifact
reference, or a documented non-operator demo-app exception. OLM- and
operator-owned images, CSV `relatedImages`, generated CR image fields,
copied CSVs, and operator-created operand Deployments are not
project-owned. Diagnose those with Subscription, installed CSV, CRD, and
generated-resource inspection, then fix durable compatibility issues
through operator lifecycle policy or product configuration.

Do not use this rule as the source of truth for specific RHOAI API fields or
live cluster operations. Use the `rhoai` or `env` rule and matching skills for
those domains.
